## Opamp
##Purpose
An operational amplifier, or opamp, is a crucial component in analog electronics designed to amplify small differential voltage signals to a higher level, typically used in applications requiring precise voltage amplification, filtering, and signal processing.
## Layout Description
A four-stage opamp is a complex circuit consisting of multiple integrator stages interconnected to achieve high voltage gain and stability. Each integrator stage typically includes active components such as metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), along with passive components like capacitors and resistors.

In a typical implementation:
Input Stage: Converts the differential input voltage into a current.
Intermediate Stages: Amplify the current using multiple stages of voltage amplification, each contributing to overall gain.
Output Stage: Converts the amplified voltage back to current for the final output.
