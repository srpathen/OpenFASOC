# MOSFET
## Purpose
A MOSFET is the basic transistor device used to build circuits. The two types of MOSFETs are the nmos or n-type or nfet and pmos or p-type or pfet. 
## Layout Description
These include four terminals: Source (S), Gate (G), Drain (D), and Body (B). However, in almost all circuits, the body terminal is internally connected to the source, so the designer mainly uses source, gate, and drain.
